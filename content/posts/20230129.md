Why have I started a blog in 2023, over a decade after blogs stopped being a thing that individuals have?
Well, the story isn't super interesting, but I always felt limited by the few hundred characters
that I could post on Twitter. Additionally the culture over there seemed to be mostly snark, dunks, arguments, and hatred.
After all of the recent-ish events that have happened at twitter I could no longer use the service.
I created a  <a rel="me" href="https://hachyderm.io/@orcutt">Mastodon</a> account,
and the culture there seems to be much better, but I still feel the limitation of only having several hundred characters.
I'll definitely try to use it more than I did Twitter.
 
 So I started a blog. I expect very few people will ever read it :joy: and that's O.K. with me!
 The site is still a work in progress, but I'm happy enough with it to go ahead and publish it.
 What will I post here? Things I'm interested in; weather things, computer things, managing humans things, books I've read, etc.
 Ultimately, time will tell how I use. I'm excited to have this space and share things with you all!
