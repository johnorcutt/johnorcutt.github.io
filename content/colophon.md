Yeah, I've shamelessly stolen this from John Gruber's wonderful [Daring Fireball](https://www.daringfireball.net). I love the idea of having a place to share the technologies and tools you're using and couldn't resist.

- Posts are written in Markdown using [BBEdit](https://www.barebones.com).
- The site is powered by [Hugo](https://www.gohugo.io) and I'm using the [Paper](https://github.com/nanxiaobei/hugo-paper) theme.
- The site is deployed on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com).
- More to come as I think of it...
