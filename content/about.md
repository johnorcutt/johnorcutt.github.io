Hi! :wave: I'm John Orcutt, a systems/software engineer building platforms for weather and climate modeling.

I'm located in the Longmont, Colorado which is situated in the Front Range region of the state. I'll use my blog to share my thoughts on things I find interesting and am passionate about. You can also follow me on [Mastodon](https://hachyderm.io/@orcutt). I intentionally am not going to allow comments here, but you can always reply or comment about my posts over on <a rel="me" href="https://hachyderm.io/@orcutt">Mastodon</a>.
